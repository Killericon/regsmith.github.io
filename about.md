This is a for fun (and my first!) website for my fantasy football league. I've been tracking most of the league information in a spreadsheet that has grown over the years and it is time to take things to the next level! This site has been a good way to learn the basics of web design and figuring out python to automate some of the management parts of the league (ex. determining keeper values)
