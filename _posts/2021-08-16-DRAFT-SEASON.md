The 2021 draft season is upon us. The date is set for **September 5th at 7 PM Mountain!** In the next few days the draft order will be determined and teams will start to think about their keepers. Will there be any pre-draft trades? Who knows! [Keeper values]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /pages/keeper_values.html %}) were updated this past weekend so the strategizing can begin.
