The finale for the LCI Championship was one of the closest we've ever had in our history. With a final score of 140.97 to 136.63 **Keith is our new league champ!** Congrats to him for his first title. Keith came in as a severe underdog. Sleeper odds gave him a 20% chance to win but his team pulled through on the back of Rashaad Penny who was picked up off waivers December 13th for $8!

Neil's team played respectably but just fell inches short. Dawson Knox choose a really bad time to throw up a goose egg. Neil still goes home with $100 after securing the best record a few weeks earlier.
