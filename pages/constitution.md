## Keepers <a name="keepers"></a>
Each team will get the option of 2 players to keep in place of a drafted player during each off season.
These players, if any, need to be submitted 1 week prior to the draft date.
A player's keeper value will be determined on 3 basis
1. 1 round higher than their previous year’s draft round
2. A player kept for a second consecutive year will cost a 1st round pick
3. Players picked up through free agency (including dropped drafted players) will have a value relative to their price. Scale is:

|$ Spent|Round|
|:-:|:-:|
|0|10|
|1-5|9|
|6-10|8|
|11-15|7|
|16-20|6|
|21-25|5|
|26-35|4|
|36-45|3|
|46-65|2|
|66-100|1|

4. Players picked up from week 13 on will receive an increasing tax in order to be kept. For example, a week 15 addition will incur an added 3 rounds to the price determined in the above table. This is a flat rate and does not differ based on the price paid.

Trading of **draft picks** during the regular season is not allowed. Once the playoffs have completed teams are open to trading any players up until the keeper deadline 1 week prior to the draft.
