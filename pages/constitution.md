## Keepers <a name="keepers"></a>
Each team will get the option of 2 players to keep in place of a drafted player during each off season.
These players, if any, need to be submitted 1 week prior to the draft date.
A player's keeper value will be determined on 3 basis
1. 1 round higher than their previous year’s draft round
2. A player kept for a second consecutive year will cost a 1st round pick
3. For players drafted that spent the majority of the year on IR with a season ending injury (ex. Saquon Barkley) will be reset to their ADP.
  - **Note:** A player must be _submitted to IR_ and miss 6+ weeks of the fantasy regular season (13 weeks). (2020: George Kittle would not qualify but Barkley and Mixon would)
  - ADP is set 1 month prior to the upcoming draft
4. Players picked up through free agency (including dropped drafted players) will have a value relative to their price. Scale is:

|$ Spent|Round|
|:-:|:-:|
|0|10|
|1-5|9|
|6-10|8|
|11-15|7|
|16-20|6|
|21-25|5|
|26-35|4|
|36-45|3|
|46-65|2|

Trading of **draft picks** during the regular season is not allowed. Once the playoffs have completed teams are open to trading any player or draft picks up until 1 hour before the draft. Owners are not allowed to trade “future” picks (ie. a 2021 pick for a 2022)
